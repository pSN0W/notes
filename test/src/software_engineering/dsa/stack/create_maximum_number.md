You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively. `nums1` and `nums2` represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer `k`.
Create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of the two numbers. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
