Given an integer n, you have to break it into smaller integers such that the sum is equal to n and the product of them is maximum

```ad-question
title: Test Case
**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 2 = 1 + 1, 1 √ó 1 = 1.
```

---
```ad-abstract
Its really same for max of n you can choose any integer from 1..n-1 and then for the other you can get max_mul using dp[i] = `j * dp[i-j]`. The only edge case you will need to consider is when you are not breaking the integer that means the n is broken into only 2 integer. so you will need to check max with j * (i-j) too.
**MATHS**
If you will look at the break you will find out that it is majorily made with 2 and 3. You want to have as much 3 as possible.

- dp[2] = 1
- for j in [1..i] dp[i] = max(max(dp[i],j*(i-j)), dp[j]* (i-j))

        vector<int> dp(n+1,-1);
        dp[2] = dp[1] = 1;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<i;j++){
                dp[i] = max(max(dp[i],j*(i-j)),dp[j]*(i-j));
            }
        }
