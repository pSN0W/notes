Given an array containing duplicates return all the unique subsets
```ad-question
title: Test Case
**Input:** nums = [1,2,2]
**Output:** [ [],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2] ]
```

# Abstract
```ad-abstract
This is similar to [[permutation_ii]]. Here you can also use the concept of [[subset]] too. If you draw the tree you will figure out that if you ignore a number then you will have to ignore it in the whole tree.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Main Logic
- If you draw the tree you will see that if you ignore a specific number in one subtree then it will be ignored throughout that subtree.
- See the commons arising when you chose to take 2 in a branch you ignored earlier. The solution for this is to keep a ignored array and only add if it is not previously. You can use set for this too.
