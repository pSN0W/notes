# Arrays
These set of problems are pretty standard and you will have to use your mind to figure things out.
## Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
- [[bubble_sort]]
- [[selection_sort]]
- [[insertion_sort]]
- [[shell_sort]]
- [[merge_sort]]
- [[quick_sort]]
- [[counting_sort]]
- [[radix_sort]]
- [[bucket_sort]]
- [[dual_pivot_quick_sort]]
- [[heap_sort]]
- [[tim_sort]]
### Sliding Window
- Type 1:
	- Fixed window length and you have to find something in the window like sum, median, min, max.
	- We need a variable to keep state of the window some as simple as integer while some are as complicated as dequeue.
- Type 2
	- The window size is not fixed it usually asks you to find subarray that meets the criteria
