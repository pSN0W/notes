- Given an array on len n return the number with frequency greater than n/2. If there are no such elements return -1.

```ad-question
title: Test Case
**Input:**
N = 3 
A[] = {1,2,3} 
**Output:**
-1
**Input:**
N = 5 
A[] = {3,1,3,3,2} 
**Output:**
3

```

```ad-abstract
The idea is pretty simple you assume that the current element that you have is the desired one. You maintain a count for it too. You iterate the array if the element is same as the number you thought of increament the count otherwise decrement it. If count reaches 0 change the expected to the current one.
At the end check if your curr is actually the answer if not return -1.

- The intuition is pretty simple assume that you know the answer and apart from that answer make all the other element as -1. Make that element as 1. Now you are just checking if the sum is > 0.
