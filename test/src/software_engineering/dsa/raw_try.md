- To pass a comparator function you can do the following
   - lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[-1])
   - Similarly you can use comparator function lst.sort(key=compare_fun)
	- Your compare function must return +1,-1 or 0 
``` 
def compare(item1, item2):
    if fitness(item1) < fitness(item2): 
	return -1 
    elif fitness(item1) > fitness(item2):
        return 1 
    else: 
        return 0
