Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes.

Given a Binary Tree **A** containing **N** nodes, return all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.

# Abstract
```ad-abstract
The idea is to store the slope in the map.
- The slope of right child remain the same
- Slope of the left child become x+1
Another option is to use a queue
- Push the element in queue only if its left is available
- Process the node and then move to its right
